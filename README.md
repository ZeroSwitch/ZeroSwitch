- ⚡ Fun fact: did you know, sunsets are an optical illusion? As our star approaches the horizon, light bends over the planet, and still reaches your eyes. However, they become redshifted. Ergo, sunsets are reds, pinks, etc.
- When in reality, the star has already dipped below the actual horizon. It's also why, at times, you notice weird visuals, like the sides of the star being cut off, jagged, etc.
